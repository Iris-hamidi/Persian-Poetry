    <h1><u>Introduction</u></h1>
    <p class="para">
        Persian poetry has one of the richest literary traditions in the world, stretching back more than a thousand years. Known as the “language of poetry,” Persian has produced countless poets whose works have shaped literature, philosophy, and mysticism across centuries. From the royal courts of ancient Persia to the gatherings of scholars and mystics, poetry was not only art but also a way of expressing love, wisdom, and spirituality. Despite the passing of centuries, the essence of Persian poetry has remained remarkably unchanged—its rhythm, rhyme, and symbolism still resonate with readers today. Often described as some of the most beautiful and meaningful poetry ever written, Persian verse has influenced cultures far beyond Persia's borders, and continues to inspire people of all languages and traditions.</p>

    <h1><u>Most Famous Persian Poets</u></h1>
    <p class="para">
        1. <u>Rumi (1207-1273):</u>
        Perhaps the most famous Persian poet, Rumi's mystical and spiritual poetry has transcended time and culture. His works, such as the "Masnavi," explore themes of divine love, unity, and the human soul's journey towards God. Rumi's poetry is celebrated for its profound wisdom and emotional depth, making him a beloved figure worldwide.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. <u>Hafez (1315-1390)</u>
        Shams ad-Din Muhammad Hafez of Shiraz is celebrated for his Divan-e-Hafez, a collection of lyrical ghazals filled with imagery of love, wine, nightingales, and roses. Hafez's poetry is deeply layered: on the surface romantic, but also mystical and philosophical. His Divan is often used for fal (divination) in Iranian culture, where people open the book at random to find spiritual guidance.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. <u>Saadi (1210-1292)</u>
        Saadi of Shiraz is admired for both his lyrical and moral poetry. His two great works are Bustan (“The Orchard”), written in verse, and Golestan (“The Rose Garden”), written in a mix of prose and poetry. His poems often stress humanity, kindness, justice, and wisdom. A verse from his Golestan—“Human beings are members of a whole, created from the same essence”—is inscribed at the entrance of the United Nations headquarters in New York.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. <u>Ferdowsi (940-1020)</u>
        Ferdowsi, the author of the Shahnameh (“Book of Kings”), gave Persian literature its national epic. Written over 30 years, this monumental work preserves the myths, history, and cultural identity of ancient Persia. Without Ferdowsi, much of Persia's pre-Islamic heritage might have been lost. His poetry is powerful, heroic, and deeply patriotic.
        <br>
        <br>
        5. <u>Omar Khayyam (1048-1131)</u>
        Though a brilliant mathematician and astronomer, Khayyam is best remembered for his Rubaiyat (“Quatrains”). These short, four-line poems are famous for their reflections on life, fate, love, and the fleeting nature of existence. His verses often carry both philosophical depth and lyrical simplicity, making them among the most widely translated Persian poems.

    <h1><u>Sample Poems (Translated into English)</u></h1>
    <p class="para">
        <br>
        'There is no vigour or joy without love,
        <br>
        There is no beauty in existence without love,
        <br>
        If one hundred raindrops fall into the sea,
        <br>
        They will never turn into pearls without love.'
        <br>
        * * *
        <br>
        'The sons of Adam are limbs of a frame,
        <br>
        For in creation, from one soul they came.
        <br>
        If hard times cause one member to feel pain,
        <br>
        At ease and rest, the others can't remain.
        <br>
        If a limb's in pain and you do not care,
        <br>
        The title 'human being' you can't share!'
        <br>
        * * *
        <br>
        In death's eye, I saw myself,
        <br>
        In love's embrace, I lost myself.
        <br>
        In the heart's depth, I found my soul,
        <br>
        In the world's vastness, I lost my goal.
        <br>
    </p>
    <h1><u>Universal Influence</u></h1>
    <p class="para">
        Persian poetry has transcended borders, languages, and centuries. The works of Rumi, Hafez, Saadi, Ferdowsi, and Khayyam have been translated into dozens of languages, including English, French, German, Russian, Chinese, and Spanish. Saadi's verse about the unity of humanity is engraved at the entrance of the United Nations building, symbolizing the global recognition of Persian humanism. Today, millions of people still turn to these poets for wisdom, inspiration, and comfort.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1><u>Poetry's Gift to the World</u></h1>
    <p class="para">
        Persian poetry is not only a reflection of Persia's cultural heritage but also a gift to the world. It combines beauty, rhythm, wisdom, and spirituality in ways that remain timeless. Whether one is reading the mystical verses of Rumi, the lyrical ghazals of Hafez, the moral lessons of Saadi, the epic heroism of Ferdowsi, or the philosophical quatrains of Khayyam, Persian poetry offers an endless source of inspiration. It continues to remind us that love, beauty, and truth are universal—and that poetry is a bridge between hearts and cultures.
